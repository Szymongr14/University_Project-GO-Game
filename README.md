Go is a board game that originated in ancient China and is played by two players who take turns placing stones on a board. The goal of the game is to control more territory than your opponent by strategically placing and capturing stones.

This project is an implementation of the Go game in C++ using a console interface on a Windows system. The program allows players to move a cursor over the board, place stones, capture opponent stones, and save and load game states. The program also implements changing the size of the board.

This project is a university assignment for the "Programming Fundamentals" course.

## Features
The project includes all mandatory requirements and several optional ones, making it a comprehensive implementation of the Go game. It is also designed with modifiability in mind, making it easy to change visual elements of the program by modifying constants.
